# Overview #
Front Camera is an Open Source Android application which allows you to take photos using the front facing camera.

Front Camera does one thing - let you take photos with the front facing camera on your device. 
It aims to make it as simple and quick as possible to take photos with the front facing camera. 
Click anywhere on the screen to take a photo, it is saved to your images automatically and ready for you to share to other apps. 
The image is automatically rotated so it gets saved upright.
The image is automatically flipped on the vertical axis so what you see in the preview matches exactly with the image that is saved.
